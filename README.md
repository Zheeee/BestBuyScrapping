# BestBuyScrapping

## Introduction
I'm pretty interested in the laptop market on the BestBuy. Therefore, I use Python to scrap the laptop information on BestBuy.
But because there are too many records, I didn't scrap the content of reviews and I only scrape half amount of reviews of each 
computers. Then I used R studio to analyze the data I got. 

## About Data
I used two spiders to get the data. One for the datials about each review. Another one for the price and selling rank about each
computers.

## Shiny App
My purpose to make this shiny app is to help me to analyze the data, so it is not that user friendly and I will try to make it 
more convinient to use in the future.
